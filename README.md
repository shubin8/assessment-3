Introduction
The program allows users to create bookings, add services, calculate total prices, and approve or reject each booking. I use several programming principles including KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), loops, and global variables. This booking system shows the code is maintainable and readable.

Features
•	Customer information: Collect customer information such as form of ID, ID number, and passenger name.
•	Service: Users can add multiple services for a single booking, along with their prices.
•	 Calculation: The program calculates the total price of all services added to the booking.
•	Booking Approval: Bookings can be approved or not approve by the booking that customer input.
•	Display Information: The program displays all the booking details and statistics, such as total bookings and their status.

How to Use
•	Enter customer information.
•	Add services and their prices.
•	Approve or reject bookings.
•	View booking details and statistics.
The program uses loops to allow multiple services and multiple bookings without repeating code, making it fast and easy to use.

Programming Principles Applied
•	KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): The program is easy, simple, and clear to understand.
•	DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): DRY methods were used to avoid repeating the same code for multiple tasks.
•	Loops: while and for loops allow repeating tasks easily, such as adding multiple services or creating multiple bookings.
•	Global variable: A global variable is used to add unique booking IDs to each booking.

Learning Outcomes
By completing this assessment, I learned how to structure Python programs using classes and objects, apply programming principles in practice, and write clear, commented code. I gained experience with loops and programming principles.

Future Improvements
•	Add error handling for wrong inputs.
•	Save bookings to a file or database.
