Introduction
The program allows users to create bookings, add services, calculate total prices, and approve or reject each booking. I use several programming principles including KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), loops, and global variables. This booking system shows the code is maintainable, readable and understandable. And last it also shows the booking details and statistics which make it perfect for customers

Features
•	Customer information: Collect customer information such as form of ID, ID number, and passenger name and print it clearly to make it clear to everyone.
•	Service: Users can add multiple services for a single booking, along with their prices without any problems, which made it easier for customers to see and add services.
•	 Calculation: The program calculates the total price of all services added to the booking right after you enter the booking details which make it easier to pay for them.
•	Booking Approval: Bookings can be approved or not approve by the booking manager that customer input.
•	Display Information: The program displays all the booking details and statistics, such as total bookings and their status to the customer to confirm their booking is completed.

How to Use
•	Enter customer information.
•	Add services and their prices.
•	Approve or reject bookings.
•	 View booking details and statistics.
The program uses loops to allow multiple services and multiple bookings without repeating code, making it fast and easy to use for customers.

Programming Principles Applied
•	KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): The program is easy, simple, and clear to understand for everyone.
•	DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): DRY methods were used to avoid repeating the same code for multiple tasks which make it easier to code and make it short.
•	Loops: while and for loops allow repeating t asks easily, such as adding multiple services or creating multiple bookings.
•	Global variable: A global variable is used to add unique booking IDs to each new booking.

Learning Outcomes
By completing this assessment, I learned how to structure Python programs using classes and objects, apply programming principles in practice, and write clearly, comment and analyze code. I gained experience with loops and programming principles. This assessment also helps me to know how real-world programming is done. As well as getting knowledge about GitHub and how to add comments and make readme files as done in real life.

Future Improvements
•	Add error handling for wrong inputs.
•	Save bookings to a file or database.
•	Add multiple services in one program to make it much easier.
